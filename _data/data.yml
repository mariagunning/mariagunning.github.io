        conference: I learned a lot from my mom. 
        details: |
         I learned a lot from my mom. I first learned to listen and be quiet since she was loud and itimidating. I was shy then and less now.
         As I grew older, I took that energy had adopted it. If it wasn't for her overwhelming abmount of confidence I would not
         be the woman I am today! Thanks mom for sharing your confidence!
